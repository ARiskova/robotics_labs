# Lab01 - Transformations
The goal of the first laboratories is to create a set o tools for transformations between frames both in 2D and 3D.
The core functionality needs to be implemented in `robotics_toolbox/core/{so2,se2,so3,se3}.py` files.

What to explain during lab:
- how to make own repository
- what is unittest
- what is @property
- what is __mul__
- what is __eq__
- complete so2.py and go through so2_example.py
- go through other lab01 examples without solution - show student what they should see if their implementation is correct
- how to upload to brute; what brute checks
- CI on GitHub (code style, tests)

## Homework
**_TBD: mandatory and voluntary parts of HW_**
